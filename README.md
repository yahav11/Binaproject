## Bina Project

A small academic project focused on working with external APIs.

The project was developed as part of a course assignment and served as hands-on practice for:
- Consuming and integrating third-party APIs
- Handling structured responses
- Working with external data sources within an application

This project does not implement AI or machine learning logic, and is intended as an exercise in API usage and integration.
